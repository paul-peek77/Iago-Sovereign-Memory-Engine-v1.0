# Iago Sovereign Memory Engine, v1.1 (ISME)

This project is provided for portfolio review only. No permission is granted for reuse, modification, or redistribution.

OVERVIEW

The Iago Sovereign Memory Engine (ISME) is an extended and refactored version of a MIT‑licensed memory engine. This version introduces new components, improved architecture, and expanded capabilities designed for AI‑adjacent workflows, persona protocols, and long‑term memory systems.

This project demonstrates:
- multi‑database memory architecture
- semantic search integration
- modular component design
- cross‑platform scripting
- AI‑focused workflow engineering
- refactoring and extending open‑source systems

KEY COMPONENTS

Memory Broker
Routes memory operations, manages database selection, and coordinates retrieval logic.

Alchemical Engine
Handles transformation, embedding, and semantic processing of memory entries.

Housekeeper
Performs automated cleanup, pruning, and maintenance tasks to keep memory stores efficient.

Semantic Search Layer
Enables vector‑based retrieval for more accurate and context‑aware memory access.

Multi‑Database Support
Allows separate memory domains (short‑term, long‑term, persona‑specific, etc.) to coexist cleanly.

KEY FEATURES

- Semantic search integration for improved retrieval
- Multi‑database architecture for structured memory domains
- Modular design for extensibility and clarity
- Automated housekeeping for long‑term stability
- Cross‑platform support (Windows + Linux)
- Refactored codebase with improved structure and maintainability

PURPOSE

This project was built to support persona protocols, AI‑adjacent workflows, and long‑term memory systems. It also serves as a demonstration of architectural thinking, refactoring skill, and system‑level design.
